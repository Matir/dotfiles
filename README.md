### About ###
This is a repository of configuration files that I like to have on all the
machines that I use.  I can just clone the repository and run "repo/setup.sh"
and get most things setup the way I like them.

### Usefulness ###
Mostly I post this to github so I can quickly grab the things I want, but it
might also be useful to others.  Feel free to raise an issue if you have any
questions.  I don't anticipating taking merge requests -- make your own
dotfiles.  ;)
